    undirectedOtherNetworks(net::HybridNetwork)

Return a vector of HybridNetwork objects, obtained by switching the placement
of each hybrid node to other nodes inside its cycle. This amounts to changing
the direction of a gene flow event (recursively to move around the whole cycle
of each reticulation).

Optional argument: `outgroup`, as a String. If an outgroup is specified,
then networks conflicting with the placement of the root are avoided.

Assumptions: `net` is assumed to be of level 1, that is, each blob has a
single cycle with a single reticulation.
All level-1 fields of `net` are assumed up-to-date.
# Example
```julia
julia> net = readnewick("(A:1.0,((B:1.1,#H1:0.2::0.2):1.2,(((C:0.52,(E:0.5)#H2:0.02::0.7):0.6,(#H2:0.01::0.3,F:0.7):0.8):0.9,(D:0.8)#H1:0.3::0.8):1.3):0.7):0.1;");
