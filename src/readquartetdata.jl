    readtableCF!(data frame)

Read a file or DataFrame object containing a table of concordance factors (CF),
with one row per 4-taxon set. The first 4 columns are assumed to give the labels
of the 4 taxa in each set (tx1, tx2, tx3, tx4).
Columns containing the CFs are assumed to be named
`CF12_34`, `CF13_24` and `CF14_23`;
or `CF12.34`, `CF13.24` and `CF14.23`;
or else are assumed to be columns 5,6,7.
If present, a column named 'ngenes' will be used to get the number of loci
used to estimate the CFs for each 4-taxon set.

Output: [`DataCF`](@ref) object

Optional arguments:

- `summaryfile`: if specified, a summary file will be created with that name.
- `delim` (for the first form only): to specify how columns are delimited,
  with single quotes: delim=';'. Default is a `csv` file, i.e. `delim=','`.
- `mergerows`: false by default. When true, will attempt to merge multiple rows
  corresponding to the same four-taxon set (by averaging their quartet CFs) even
  if none of the species is repeated within any row (that is, in any set of 4 taxa)

The last version modifies the input data frame, if species are represented by multiple alleles
for instance (see [`readtableCF!`](@ref)(data frame, columns)).

    readtableCF!(data frame, columns; mergerows=false)

Read in quartet CFs from data frame, assuming information is in columns numbered `columns`,
of length **7 or 8**: 4 taxon labels then 3 CFs then ngenes possibly.

If some species appears more than once in the same 4-taxon set (e.g. t1,t1,t2,t3),
then the data frame is modified to remove rows (4-taxon sets) that are uninformative about
between-species relationships. This situation may occur if multiple individuals are sampled from
the same species. A 4-taxon set is uninformative (and its row is removed)
if one taxon is repeated 3 or 4 times (like t1,t1,t1,t1 or t1,t2,t2,t2).
The list of species appearing twice in some 4-taxon sets is stored in the output DataCF object.
For these species, the length of their external edge is identifiable (in coalescent units).
If multiple rows correspond to the same 4-taxon set, these rows are merged and their CF values
(and number of genes) are averaged.
If none of the species is repeated within any 4-taxon set, then this averaging
is attempted only if `mergerows` is true.

    readtableCF!(DataCF, data frame, columns)

Modify the `.quartet.obsCF` values in the `DataCF` object with those read from the data frame
in columns numbered `columns`.
`columns` should have **3** columns numbers for the 3 CFs in this order:
`12_34`, `13_24` and `14_23`.

Assumptions:
- same 4-taxon sets in `DataCF` and in the data frame, and in the same order,
  but this assumption is *not checked* (for speed, e.g. during bootstrapping).
- one single row per 4-taxon set (multiple individuals representatives
  of the same 4-taxon set should have been already merged);
  basically: the DataCF should have been created from the data frame by `readtableCF!(df, colums)`

    readInputData(trees, whichQuartets, numQuartets, taxonlist,   writetable, tablename, writeQfile, writesummary)

Read gene trees and calculate the observed quartet concordance factors (CF),
that is, the proportion of genes (and the number of genes) that display each
quartet for a given list of four-taxon sets.

Input:

- `trees`: name of a file containing a list of input gene trees,
  or vector of trees (`HybridNetwork` objects)

Optional arguments (defaults):

- `quartetfile`: name of a file containing a list of quartets, or more precisely,
  a list of four-taxon sets
- `whichQuartets` (`:all`): which quartets to sample.
  `:all` for all of them, `:rand` for a random sample.
- `numQuartets`: number of quartets in the sample.
  default: total number of quartets if `whichQuartets=:all`
  and 10% of total if `whichQuartets=:rand`
- `taxonlist` (all in the input gene trees):
  If `taxonlist` is used, `whichQuartets` will consist of *all* sets of 4 taxa in the `taxonlist`. 
- `writetable` (true): write the table of observed CF?
- `tablename` ("tableCF.txt"): if `writetable` is true, the table of observed CFs is write to file `tablename`
- `writeQfile` (false): write intermediate file with sampled quartets?
- `writesummary` (true): write a summary file?
  if so, the summary will go in file "summaryTreesQuartets.txt".

Uses [`calculateObsCFAll!`](@ref), which implements a slow algorithm.

See also:
[`PhyloNetworks.countquartetsintrees`](@extref), which uses a much faster algorithm;
[`readtrees2CF`](@ref), which is an exported and user-friendly re-naming of `readInputData`, and
[`readtableCF`](@ref) to read a table of quartet CFs directly.
