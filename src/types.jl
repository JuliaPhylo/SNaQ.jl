    QuartetNetwork(net::HybridNetwork)

Subtype of `Network` abstract type.
A `QuartetNetwork` object is an internal type used to calculate the
expected CFs of quartets on a given network.
Attributes of the `QuartetNetwork` objects need not be updated at a given time (see below).

The procedure to calculate expected CFs for a given network is as follows:
1. A `QuartetNetwork` object is created for each `Quartet` using
   `extractQuartet!(net,d)` for `net::HybridNetwork` and `d::DataCF`
2. The vector `d.quartet` has all the `Quartet` objects, each with a `QuartetNetwork`
   object (`q.qnet`). Attibutes in `QuartetNetwork` are not updated at this point
3. Attributes in `QuartetNetwork` are partially updated when calculating the
   expected CF (`calculateExpCFAll!`). To calculate the expected CF for this quartet,
   we need to update the attributes: `which`, `typeHyb`, `t1`, `split`, `formula`, `expCF`.
   To do this, we need to modify the `QuartetNetwork` object (i.e. merge edges,...).
   But we do not want to modify it directly because it is connected to the original
   `net` via a map of the edges and nodes, so we use a deep copy:
   `qnet=deepcopy(q.qnet)` and then `calculateExpCFAll!(qnet)`.
   Attributes that are updated on the original `QuartetNetwork` object `q.qnet` are:
    - `q.qnet.hasEdge`: array of booleans of length equal to `net.edge` that shows which identifiable edges and gammas of `net` (`ht(net)`) are in `qnet` (and still identifiable). Note that the first elements of the vector correspond to the gammas.
    - `q.qnet.index`: length should match the number of trues in `qnet.hasEdge`. It has the indexes in `qnet.edge` from the edges in `qnet.hasEdge`. Note that the first elements of the vector correspond to the gammas.
    - `q.qnet.edge`: list of edges in `QuartetNetwork`. Note that external edges in `net` are collapsed when they appear in `QuartetNetwork`, so only internal edges map directly to edges in `net`
    - `q.qnet.expCF`: expected CF for this `Quartet`


Why not modify the original `QuartetNetwork`? We wanted to keep the original
`QuartetNetwork` stored in `DataCF` with all the identifiable edges, to be able
to determine if this object had been changed or not after a certain optimization.

The process is:

1. Deep copy of full network to create `q.qnet` for `Quartet q`.
   This `QuartetNetwork` object has only 4 leaves now, but does not have merged edges
   (the identifiable ones) so that we can correspond to the edges in net.
   This `QuartetNetwork` does not have other attributes updated.
2. For the current set of branch lengths and gammas, we can update the attributes
   in `q.qnet` to compute the expected CF. The functions that do this will "destroy"
   the `QuartetNetwork` object by merging edges, removing nodes, etc... So, we do
   this process in `qnet=deepcopy(q.qnet)`, and at the end, only update `q.qnet.expCF`.
3. After we optimize branch lengths in the full network, we want to update the
   branch lengths in `q.qnet`. The edges need to be there (which is why we do
   not want to modify this `QuartetNetwork` object by merging edges), and
   we do not do a deep-copy of the full network again. We only change the values
   of branch lengths and gammas in `q.qnet`, and we can re-calculate the expCF
   by creating a deep copy `qnet=deepcopy(q.qnet)` and run the other functions
   (which merge edges, etc) to get the `expCF`.

Future work: there are definitely more efficient ways to do this (without the deep copies).
In addition, currently edges that are no longer identifiable in `QuartetNetwork`
do not appear in `hasEdge` nor `index`. Need to study this.
