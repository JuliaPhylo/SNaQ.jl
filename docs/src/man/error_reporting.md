# SNaQ error reporting

Please report any bugs and errors by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/juliaphylo/SNaQ.jl/issues/new).
The easiest way to provide information on the error is by checking the
`.err` file, which will show the number of runs that
failed and the corresponding seed to replicate the run.
In case of an error, the `.err` file might look like:
`Total errors: 1 in seeds [4545]`.
This file and any information that will help replicating the error
will be immensely helpful to fix the error/bug.
